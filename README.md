# Objective

My goal is to create using 3D C# graphics a simplified simulation of stellar evolution at a rapid scale, with sufficiently different parameters from the natural world to serve as a sort of artistic display. The goal is to have a stellar nursery sustain star growth for a substantial period of time with a realistic simulation of gravityâ€”and more aesthetically, a sort of hazy blinking light display like fireflies (ooh, I wonder if I can simulate those). The name is temporary and subject to change.
